useState is a React Hook that lets you add state 
(i.e., memory) to a function component.

Why use it?
In a normal JavaScript function, once it runs, all variables inside are gone.
But in a React component, we want to:
Remember values (e.g., a count, input text)
Update the UI when those values change

Basic syntax
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);

state: current value
setState: function to update it
initialValue: what the state starts as (e.g. 0, "", [])
