The useEffect hook in React is a fundamental tool for performing "side effects" in 
functional components. 
Side effects are operations that interact with the outside world, such as:
Data fetching: Making API calls to retrieve or send data.
DOM manipulation: Directly interacting with the browser's Document Object Model 
(e.g., setting the document title, adding event listeners).
Subscriptions: Setting up and cleaning up subscriptions to external services 
(e.g., chat services, real-time data feeds).
Timers: Using setTimeout or setInterval.
How useEffect works:
Callback Function: The useEffect hook takes a function as its first argument. This function contains the code for your side effect.
JavaScript

    useEffect(() => {
      // Side effect code here
    }, []);
